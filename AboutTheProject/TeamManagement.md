## Cooperation Plan

This section is all about us, our strength points and how are we going to utilitze it.

**Anas**: Multi-Tasking and helpful in creating a daily plan-to-do, utilizing and finding source codes of similar functionalities to learn from that would help us create our project.

**Abdullah**: Critcizing and Evaluating each functionality then study what is cruicial and what is not so we can focus on important targets first while building our project.

**Hasan**: Team Management and Tasks distribution then designing the workflow of our project, collecting the features to build and integrating it.

**Tasneem**: Clearly and Skillfully Utilizing her Visualization skills, to illustrate each functionality of our website and designing the structure of our project.

- We all have the same aspect of developing our skills in all fields of building that project, our aim is learn from each others as we go ahead with work.

- The approach we follow to clear up our day-day workflow, is that we are daily discussing the structure and end result we are aiming to achieve then the next day we distribute tasks to finish certain parts of the whole process, it's like Discuss -> Distribute -> Apply -> Assess -> Repeat.

## Conflict Plan

- Resolving conflicts will be based on negotiations, we will allow each person to put his opinion about the conflict on the table, and then everyone can vote to which opinion is rather be the good one. after that respectfully we follow the majority opinion.

- Talking about if somebody was incooperative, we will talk to that person first and convince him/her with a workflow that will all agree on, otherwise if insisted on the mistake, they will be reported to the project manager.

- Since we are working mostly in team of two, there will be no certain fixed level of skill, so we could help each others and once somebody face a problem we all get in one channel of discord to help each others.

- In situation where somebody doesn't contribute as required, we will notify that person and let them know that it's required to put more effort.

- The conflict shouldn't be escalated, we should focus on the project success and not to make problems out of nowhere, so the project is the priority.

## Communication  Plan

The communication plan is clear for us, the time of communication mainly will be at the work hours on our project using communication methods such as Slack and Discord. Breaks will be every 2 hours of work we take half an hour of break to regenerate our energy.
Falling behind isn't an option, we made already a plan to finish before 1 week of the deadline. so we aren't planning to use the whole period just building the application. and about communication on weekends and the environment communication, we will still be communication on the mentioned methods and we already agreed on a code of conduct of how the communication should be respectful, no negativity and no personal critism, everything should be appropriate.

## Work Plan

The work approach is Feature-Based-Work, everydays morning tasks will be distributed, some are individual and some are team tasks, Hasan as a team manager use Trello to distribute the tasks on the team then on lab times and after we work on the assinged tasks to finish through the day, lastly we meet again and push all the finished features on git hub.

## Git Process

The Main components (Repositories) are the back-end Repo & front-end Repo. Both are shared though an organization. the git flow is that we all each day pull the most recent main branch, then for each feature we make a new branch, then any completed feature will be reviewed using the reviewr on github as we are all in vocal meeting making sure no conflicts will occur and if happened to resolve them together, once everything is resolved only the Admin of the organizaiton will merge the features into the main branch and the next day we repeat. the merge number is based on the features numbers. the time for merge is at the end of each day.
