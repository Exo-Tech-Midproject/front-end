# Name of Project: Exo-tech

***Summary of Idea:***

- Exo-tech is a Portable Pharmacy/Clinic platform that aims to connect patients and physicians in an efficient manner. The platform offers features such as patient health profile management, disease control tracking, physician dashboards, patient education groups, a Q&A section, a rating system, and a live chat system for consultations. By bringing together these essential functionalities, Exo-tech seeks to enhance patient care, improve medication management, and foster better communication between patients and healthcare professionals.

***Problem Solving:***

- Medication Management: Many patients struggle to keep track of their health parameters and medication schedules, leading to potential health risks.
- Limited Patient Education: Patients may lack the necessary knowledge and support to manage their conditions effectively, resulting in bad health outcomes.
- Communication Gap: Quick and efficient communication between patients and physicians is important especially in case of emergencies or critical health events.
